Initially started with Tensorflow getting started tutorial and made the below submissions


List of Submissions I have made to Kaggle and Progress


wrote the fully connected layer with an accuaracy of 91 %
    (Not submitted in Kaggle)

Below 6 are submitted to kaggle  (4, 5 aren’t of much progress)

Wrote 3 layer CNN with 1 fully connected and an accuracy of 96%
File name : Code : mnist_nn_final.py 
          Result : submission_1.csv    
Increased on the data set sizes and improvised the batch set and made accuracy to 97%          
File name : Code : mnist_nn_final_2ndSubmit.py
          Result : submission_2.csv
4, 5 aren’t much progress 

     6. Developed 7 CNN and submitted the code still accuracy remains at 95%
File name : Code : mnist_7lay_submitted.py
          Result : 


     7. Identifed a bug in 7 CNN and resubmitted. 
File name : Code : mnist_7layers_modified.py
          Result : submission_2.csv




Analysis 


Used different optimizers and there isn’t much difference as the dataset is relatively small, could able to see all boiling down to similar error rates.

Faced issues with data extraction, fixed bugs and improved accuracy by designing 7 layer CNN with architecture “CCCPCCCPFF”
